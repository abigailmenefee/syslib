# Library Site Architecture

**Objective**
The purpose of the final assignment was to develop an interwoven library
site architecture, which connects WordPress to Koha and Omeka. To accomplish
this objective, only the path to Koha and Omeka was required, but I
decided to dive into how to create a link back to the WordPress, to
develop a truly interwoven site.

## WordPress to Koha and Omeka
To link a page to an external site, it is necessary to install and activate
an additional plug-in on WordPress called the Page Links To plug-in. Once
this is activated, it is a simple task to go to the each page, click on
their page settings, and add a custom link. 


## Omeka to WordPress
To link a page to an external site in Omeka, it is necessary to go to the
Appearances settings within Omeka, and then add an additional link in the
Navigation Panel.


## Koha to WordPress
To link to an external site in Koha, knowledge in HTML customization is
required; however, a default HTML script is provided in Koha documentation.
To add this link, it is necessary to go to the Tools module within Koha and
then to HTML customizations. This allows you to add OPACMoreSearches to the
Navigation Panel. I was able to then add a Home link back to the WordPress.

Then it was a matter of customization and thematic cohension!
