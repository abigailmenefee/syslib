# Week 6 Challenge Walkthrough

# Description of the Issue
This week I accidentally cloned Dr. Burns syslib GitHub Repository  
per his initial video. I initially struggled with removing this  
Repository because it was not empty. When I deleted the files  
contained within the repository, the system still indicated that
the repository was not empty. I then utilized the -a modifier to 
show the hidden .git directory, which lead to a few other directories.  
After also removing these directories, I was able to eventually remove
Dr. Burns syslib GitHub Repository.  

# Reflection
This should impact Dr. Burns actual syslib GitHub Repository because:

1. It was a cloned repository.
2. No changes were committed and pushed to the Dr. Burns GitHub.
3. Therefore, removal of the directory occurred without any consenquence.
