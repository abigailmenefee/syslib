## Install Apache2
After ensuring virtual machine is updated,
install apache2:

`sudo apt install apache2`

## Basic Checks
1. By utilizing `cd /var/log`, I am now able
to identify the apache2 directory. After utilizing
`cd apache2` and conducting `ls`, I now have access
to an `access.log` and `error.log`.

## Creating a Web Page
1. Install w3m, a command line web browser.
1. Once installed, I can no run:

`w3m 127.0.0.1` or `w3m localhost`

1. By utilizing `ip a`, I can identify my NIC, and use
this to conduct `w3m [NIC IP Address]`
1. By utilizing, the NIC IP Address, the Loopback IP
Address (LocalHost), I can visit default site. I can
also utilize the External IP Address for my VIrtual Machine
to access a graphical version of this Apache 2 Ubuntu
default page.
